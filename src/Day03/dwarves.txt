Far over the misty mountains cold,
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away, ere break of day
To seek our pale enchanted gold.

The dwarves of yore made mighty spells
While hammers fell, like ringing bells
In places deep, where dark things sleep,
In hollow halls beneath the fells.

For ancient king and elvish lord
There many a gleaming golden hoard
They shaped and wrought, and light they caught
To hide in gems on hilt of sword.

On silver necklaces they strung,
The flowering stars on crowns they hung,
The dragon-fire in twisted wire
They meshed the light of moon and sun!
